MAIN BRANCH
The branches (in CVS) formerly known as 'guiclient' and 'plantwizard' have been
combined to form the Main Branch. This will make it easier for users to isolate the correct 
download. Previously this project was split up into around seven downloads.
Main scripts:

anatomicgui.py (or anatomicgui.exe for windows) - This is the main download client.
plantwizard.py (or plantwizard.exe for windows) - This is the plant wizard which enables 
users to distribute files on the Anatomic P2P Network.
anaupdatesnodes.py (or anaupdatesnodes.exe for windows) - This script updates supernodes and is temporary.

KNOWN ISSUES
GTK+ may throw some very minor error messages out now and then.
There is a small bug when closing the program that means python may not close gracefully.
