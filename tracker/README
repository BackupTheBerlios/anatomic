What to do with this script?
============================

It is best to use a subdomain for this script.

	Make a folder with any name e.g. 'tracker' on the web server
	This folder NEEDS to have 'chmod 777 tracker -Rf' done on it
	Copy all *.php files and the folder 'multiseed' into the folder
	Everything will need to have 'chmod 777 * -Rf' done on it too

Notifying a supertracker about your tracker.
============================================

This is important or else your tracker will be useless

	Make sure you can access index.php without any errors
	Visit any supertracker webpage
	Put your tracker url in the 'Submit Tracker' box and Submit it
	The response should be positive
	This should be done a few times

Active Supertrackers as of 22 APR 04 are:
