1. System Requirements
    PHP 4
    MySQL Server (Version 4 or greater recommended)
    Web server (Apache, lighttpd, IIS if you can't avoid it ;-))
    PhpMyAdmin also recommended but not necessary

2. Install
This script is far simpler to install now.
Create a database ( the name does not matter ).
Run database_mysql.sql using phpmyadmin or from the command line.
Edit common.php to match your database settings.
Upload the files (if necessary)

Visit index.php in a browser and add the following trackers and supertrackers
using the text entry box:
Supertracker:
  http://anatomic.berlios.de/network/node-a/cache.php
  http://anatomic.5gigs.com/node-c/cache.php
  (Your own url)
Trackers:
  http://anatomic.berlios.de/network/tracker-a/announce.php
  http://anatomic.5gigs.com/tracker-c/announce.php

At this early stage in Anatomic P2P I would advise notifying me if a supertracker
is made at: kunky@mail.berlios.de

Thank you for supporting Anatomic P2P
